# 10yearsStackoverflow
The two pieces of code that won me, my second and third Stackoverflow swag!

The <kbd>[God of Time](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/318910/time-for-some-more-swag/319020#319020)</kbd> post, chrono-ception!

<kbd>[Live Demo](http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~gsamaras/soCheese.html)</kbd>, where the user had to solve a riddle to find out that the answer is 4.4, input that, and then watch the encrypted message unveil its content!
